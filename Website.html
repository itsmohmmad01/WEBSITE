      <p>Nature is the term used to describe all of the natural phenomena that occur in the world. It includes animals, plants, minerals, and elements that exist in Earth’s ecosystem. Nature is a huge part of our lives. It has been with us since the beginning of time and will continue to be with us for as long as we are on this planet. Nature can make or break our day-to-day life and it has a huge impact on how we interact with one another. Nature is an all-encompassing term that can mean different things depending on your point of view or perspective.</p>

      <p>Humans are prone to cynicism, and we often pull ourselves down by reflecting our negative qualities on a higher note. What we actually need to do is to reflect more on the things we have planned about and what we are looking forward to. One can choose to explore their meritorious capabilities, which can range from developing hobbies to polished talents. This in turn will also work to boost your motivation towards any goal you set for yourself. Here, we have shared samples of the About Myself Essay, which will guide you on how and what ou should add to your essay.</p>
